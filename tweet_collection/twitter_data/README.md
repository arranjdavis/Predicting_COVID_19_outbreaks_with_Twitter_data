# Twitter data

This directory will contain separate CSV files, each containing all the tweets on a given day with location data from each of the countries where tweets were collected: the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, and The Netherlands. The titles of the CSV files contain the country the tweets are from and the date on which the tweets were created (e.g., `uk_tweets_2019_11_01.csv`, `spain_tweets_2019_12_01.csv`). The dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
